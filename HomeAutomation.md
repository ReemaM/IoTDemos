### Create Watson IoT Devices in IBM Watson IoT Platform 

After creating an Internet of Things Platform in IBM Cloud, click on Launch to go to IBM IoT Platform page.

![`Internet_of_Things_Platform`](images/Internet_of_Things_Platform.png)

Then go to Devices tab form the left side and **click** on ADD Device. **Note:_Remember Your Organization ID_**

![`Create-Watson-IoT-Devices`](images/Create-Watson-IoT-Devices.png)

Fill all the important information.







![`Create-Watson-IoT-Devices2`](images/Create-Watson-IoT-Devices2.png)

Fill the authentication Token or keep it empty to be generated for you.

![`Create-Watson-IoT-Devices3`](images/Create-Watson-IoT-Devices3.png)

These are important information to access to this device. **Save and keep them safe**.

### Configure your Node-RED application on Raspberry pi

#### Add ibm-watson-iot Nodes to your Node-RED
Check your Nodes pane on the left side if it has an ibm-watson-iot nodes as it shown in folloing figure. 

![`IBMWatson-IoT`](images/IBMWatson-IoT.png)

\* *skip this step if you have* \*
If you don't have, select manage palette from the top right menu.

![`Translator`](images/8.jpg)

At the manage palette menu click on the Install tab then search for ```ibm-watson-iot```. After that, install node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot and close the palette menu.

![`ibm-watson-iot`](images/ibm-watson-iot.png)


Search for **Watson IoT** nodes from the upper left filter section then drag and drop it.  







![`Configur-Watson-IoT`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT.png)


Double click on the node and click on the pencil icon for configuring your watson IoT credentials

![`Configur-Watson-IoT2`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT2.png)

Fill the all the important fields according to the your devices credentials on IBM Watson IoT platform that created earlier.
\* **Note:** write your server as the following ; ```[your_organizer_id].messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com```

![`Configur-Watson-IoT3`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT3.png)

Click on **Deploy** to check if your node is connected successfully. 



![`Configur-Watson-IoT4`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT4.png)



If shows *disconnected* and all the information correct, go to **Logs** under your device in IBM Watson IoT platform. You'll see the same message because the security. **_Save your IP_**




![`Configur-Watson-IoT5`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT5.png)

Then go to **Policies** and click on the pencil icon next to *Whitelist* to add your IP.




![`Configur-Watson-IoT6`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT6.png)

Add your IP address that showed earlier to Whitelist.



![`Configur-Watson-IoT7`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT7.png)


Redeploy your Node-RED flow. Now you have configured the Watson IoT part on Raspberry Pi.


![`Configur-Watson-IoT8`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT8.png)






### Create Watson IoT APP in IBM Watson IoT Platform 

Go to *IBM Watson IoT platform* and click on **Apps**. *Generate API key* then save your credentials and keep them safe.

![`Create-Watson-IoT-APP`](images/Create-Watson-IoT-APP.png)


### Configure your Node-RED application on IBM Cloud


Open your Node-RED on IBM Cloud then drag and drop IBM IoT.



![`Configur-IBM-IoT`](images/Configur-IBM-IoT.png)

Then double click on the node and click on the pencil icon for configuring your IBM IoT credentials
![`Configur-IBM-IoT2`](images/Configur-IBM-IoT2.png)

Fill all fields according to the your API credentials on IBM Watson IoT platform that created earlier.
\* **Note:** write your server as the following ; ```[your_organizer_id].messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com```

![`Configur-IBM-IoT3`](images/Configur-IBM-IoT3.png)

### Create your Node-RED flow on Raspberry pi




Copy the code form the [Node_RED_Raspberry_Pi_flow](Node_RED_Raspberry_Pi_flow) flow and import them into **Raspberry Pi** Node-RED clipboard:



![`Import_flow`](images/Import_flow.png)

Then, configure Watson IoT node.

Finally, your flow should look like the following figure. Click on Deploy button in the upper right


![`Node-red-in-Raspberry-pi`](images/Node-red-in-Raspberry-pi.png)

### Create your Node-RED flow on IBM Cloud


If you don't have DashBoard, select manage palette from the top right menu.

![`Translator`](images/8.jpg)

At the manage palette menu click on the Install tab then search for ```node-red-dashboard```. After that, install node-red-dashboard and close the palette menu.


After that, copy the code form the [Node_RED_IBM_Cloud_flow](Node_RED_IBM_Cloud_flow) flow and import them into **IBM Cloud** Node-RED clipboard:



![`Import_flow`](images/Import_flow.png)

Then, configure Watson IoT node.

Finally, your flow should look like the following figure. Click on Deploy button in the upper right


![`Node-red-in-Cloud`](images/Node-red-in-Cloud.png)


To see your dashboard, go to ```[yourdomain] /ui ```


![`Node-red-in-Cloud-UI`](images/Node-red-in-Cloud-UI.png)


**_Congratulations!!_**
