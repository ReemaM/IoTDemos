### Configure your Node-RED application on Raspberry pi

#### Add ibm-watson-iot Nodes to your Node-RED
Check your Nodes pane on the left side if it has an ibm-watson-iot nodes as it shown in folloing figure. 

![`IBMWatson-IoT`](images/IBMWatson-IoT.png)

\* *skip this step if you have* \*
If you don't have, select manage palette from the top right menu.

![`Translator`](images/8.jpg)

At the manage palette menu click on the Install tab then search for ```ibm-watson-iot```. After that, install node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot and close the palette menu.

![`ibm-watson-iot`](images/ibm-watson-iot.png)


Search for **Watson IoT** nodes from the upper left filter section then drag and drop it.  







![`Configur-Watson-IoT`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT.png)


Double click on the node and click on the pencil icon for configuring your watson IoT credentials

![`Configur-Watson-IoT2`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT2.png)

Fill the all the important fields according to the your devices credentials on IBM Watson IoT platform that created earlier.
\* **Note:** write your server as the following ; ```[your_organizer_id].messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com```

![`Configur-Watson-IoT3`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT3.png)

Click on **Deploy** to check if your node is connected successfully. 



![`Configur-Watson-IoT4`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT4.png)



If shows *disconnected* and all the information correct, go to **Logs** under your device in IBM Watson IoT platform. You'll see the same message because the security. **_Save your IP_**




![`Configur-Watson-IoT5`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT5.png)

Then go to **Policies** and click on the pencil icon next to *Whitelist* to add your IP.




![`Configur-Watson-IoT6`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT6.png)

Add your IP address that showed earlier to Whitelist.



![`Configur-Watson-IoT7`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT7.png)


Redeploy your Node-RED flow. Now you have configured the Watson IoT part on Raspberry Pi.


![`Configur-Watson-IoT8`](images/Configur-Watson-IoT8.png)






### Create Watson IoT APP in IBM Watson IoT Platform 

Go to *IBM Watson IoT platform* and click on **Apps**. *Generate API key* then save your credentials and keep them safe.

### Configure your Node-RED application on IBM Cloud


Open your Node-RED on IBM Cloud then drag and drop IBM IoT.



![`Configur-IBM-IoT`](images/Configur-IBM-IoT.png)

Then double click on the node and click on the pencil icon for configuring your IBM IoT credentials
![`Configur-IBM-IoT2`](images/Configur-IBM-IoT2.png)

Fill all fields according to the your API credentials on IBM Watson IoT platform that created earlier.

\* **Note:** write your server as the following ; ```[your_organizer_id].messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com```

## Building an IoT application

### Configure IBM IoT platform

Now, this is Node-RED editer and we need to add IBM Watson IoT nodes, so select manage palette from the top right menu.

![`Translator`](images/8.jpg)

At the manage palette menu click on the Install tab then search for ```node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot```. After that, install node-red-contrib-telegrambot and close the palette menu.

![`Translator`](images/ibm-watson-iot.png)

Search for telegram nodes from the upper left filter section then drag and drop Telegram receiver and Telegram sender nodes.  
![`Translator`](images/10.png)



### Creating Node-RED
To create and configur Node-RED app, go to your IBM Cloud account and click Catalog then choice Starter Kits from the lift side then choice Node-RED Starter as shown in the following figure.

![`Translator`](images/3.png)



After that, Fill-out the fields to create IoT Platform:
- App name: has to be unique in the IBM cloud domain.
- Host name: will be filled out automatically based on the App name.

click on Create 
![`Translator`](images/4.png)

Then, wait seconds until shows the application shows Running and click on Visit App URL

![`Translator`](images/5.png)

After that, for first time, it will ask you to setup the username and password. Please follow the instruction to secure your editor so only authorized users can access it.

Then, click on "Go to your Node-RED flow editor".

![`Translator`](images/7.png)

### Configure the Telegram 
Now, this is Node-RED editer and we need to add Telegram nodes, so select manage palette from the top right menu.

![`Translator`](images/8.jpg)

At the manage palette menu click on the Install tab then search for telegram. After that, install node-red-contrib-telegrambot and close the palette menu.

![`Translator`](images/9.png)

Search for telegram nodes from the upper left filter section then drag and drop Telegram receiver and Telegram sender nodes.  
![`Translator`](images/10.png)
Double click on the Telegram receiver node and click on the pencil icon for configuring your bot credentials

![`Translator`](images/11.png)

Fill the bot-name and token fields according to the bot credentials you created earlier.

![`Translator`](images/12.png)

In Telegram sender node select the bot credentials you created in Telegram receiver node (example_bot in my case).

![`Translator`](images/13.png)

Now you have configured the Telegram part on Node-RED. You can test it by connecting the Telegram receiver node to the Telegram sender node.

![`Translator`](images/14.png)

You can send a message to your bot on Telegram and it will echo the message you wrote. That's because we forwarded the message payload directly to the Telegram sender.
